Open source password management solution.

## About

Bitwarden is an open-source password manager that can store sensitive
information such as website credentials in an encrypted vault.

The Bitwarden platform offers a variety of client applications including
a web interface, desktop applications, browser extensions and mobile apps.

This app is based upon the lightweight and opensource
[Vaultwarden][vaultwarden] implementation, allowing you to self-host
this amazing password manager.

Password theft is a serious problem. The websites and apps that you use are
under attack every day. Security breaches occur and your passwords are stolen.
When you reuse the same passwords everywhere hackers can easily access your
email, bank, and other important accounts. USE A PASSWORD MANAGER!
